In a React project, the views folder is typically used to store the main view components or pages of the application. 
These components often represent the different routes or screens within your application and are composed of multiple smaller components.

Common Uses of the views Folder

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page Components:

Components that represent full pages or views in the application, often corresponding to different routes.
Example: views/Home.js, views/About.js, views/Dashboard.js

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Route Definitions:

Defining routes that map URLs to specific view components.
Example: views/routes.js

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Layout Integration:

Integrating with layout components to provide consistent structure and appearance across different views.
Example: views/MainLayout.js wrapping individual views.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
View-Specific State Management:

Handling state and logic that is specific to a particular view.
Example: Fetching data or managing form state within a view component.
