In a React project, the styles folder is typically used to organize all the styling-related files and resources.
This includes CSS, SCSS, or styled-components files that define the visual appearance of the application. By centralizing styling resources,
 the styles folder helps maintain a consistent and organized approach to styling across the project.

Common Uses of the styles Folder
Global Styles:

Styles that are applied globally across the entire application.
Example: styles/global.css, styles/reset.css

//-Global styles are typically used to reset default browser styles, define base typography, and set up global layout styles.
//-These styles are usually imported in the main App component to ensure they are applied to all components in the application.
//-Global styles can also include CSS variables, custom fonts, and other global settings that need to be consistent throughout the application.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Component-Specific Styles:

Styles that are specific to individual components, often organized in the same way as the component structure.
Example: styles/Header.css, styles/Footer.css

//-Component-specific styles are used to define the visual appearance of individual components.
//-These styles are typically imported directly into the component file using CSS modules or other styling solutions.
//-By keeping component styles separate from global styles, it is easier to maintain and update the styling for each component independently.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Utility Classes:

Reusable utility classes that can be applied to various elements throughout the application.
Example: styles/utilities.css

//-Utility classes are used to define common styles that can be applied to multiple elements in the application.
//-These classes are often used for spacing, alignment, typography, and other common styling patterns.
//-By centralizing utility classes in a single file, it is easier to maintain and reuse these styles across different components.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Theme Files:

Files that define themes for the application, such as light and dark modes.
Example: styles/theme.css, styles/darkTheme.css

//-Theme files are used to define different visual themes for the application, such as color schemes, typography settings, and other theme-specific styles.
//-These files can be switched dynamically based on user preferences or other conditions to change the appearance of the application.
//-By organizing theme-related styles in separate files, it is easier to manage and maintain different themes for the application.
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mixins and Variables (for SCSS):

SCSS mixins and variables that are used to keep styles DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and maintainable.
Example: styles/mixins.scss, styles/variables.scss

//-SCSS mixins are reusable blocks of styles that can be included in other style rules to avoid repetition and keep styles maintainable.
//-SCSS variables are used to define reusable values that can be referenced throughout the stylesheets, such as colors, font sizes, and spacing values.
//-By organizing mixins and variables in separate files, it is easier to manage and reuse these styles across different components and stylesheets.
