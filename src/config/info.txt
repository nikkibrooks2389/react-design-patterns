In a React project, the config folder is typically used to store configuration files and
settings that are required for various aspects of the project. These configuration files can include settings for
different environments (development, testing, production), as well as configuration for tools and libraries that the project depends on.
Here are some common uses for the config folder in a React project:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment-Specific Settings:

You can have different configuration files for different environments, such as development, production, and testing. These files might contain environment-specific settings like API endpoints, feature flags, and other environment-dependent variables.
Example: config/development.js, config/production.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build and Deployment Configuration:

Configuration settings for build tools like Webpack, Babel, or Vite. These files dictate how the project is built and bundled.
Example: config/webpack.config.js, config/babel.config.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application Settings:

General application settings that are used throughout the app, such as theme settings, default values, or constants.
Example: config/appSettings.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third-Party Services Configuration:

Configuration for third-party services and libraries, such as analytics, logging, or authentication providers.
Example: config/firebaseConfig.js, config/sentryConfig.js

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Custom Scripts:

Custom scripts for automation tasks, such as deployment scripts, testing scripts, or scripts for setting up the local development environment.
Example: config/deploy.js, config/setup.js

Example Structure
Here is an example of what a config folder might look like in a React project:

config/
├── env/
├──   development.js
├──   production.js
├──   testing.js
├── appSettings.js
├── webpack.config.js
├── babel.config.js
├── firebaseConfig.js
├── deploy.js
├── setup.js
The config folder can help keep your project organized and make it easier to manage different settings and configurations.
